Hi everyone,

I wanted to provide an update regarding the Clendar app. Due to some personal matters, I haven't been able to dedicate much time to maintaining the app recently.

I'm truly grateful for all the support and contributions from the Open Source community over the past years. Your encouragement and assistance have meant a lot to me and motivated me to continually improve the app. Unfortunately, I've had to step back temporarily to address some personal matters.

[This app started out as just my personal project to catch up with annual WWDC changes](https://github.com/vinhnx/Clendar?tab=readme-ov-file#about), and one day I decided to convert the whole app from Swift & UIKit to SwiftUI.

The rest is history, and the stars keep rising üåü‚ù§Ô∏è.

Words simply cannot describe how grateful I am for all your [contributions and warm messages](https://github.com/vinhnx/Clendar/issues). I'm touched that everyone [loves](https://github.com/vinhnx/Clendar/stargazers) this small app and project as much as I do.

Clendar will always be in my heart.

Thank you for your understanding and patience. I look forward to resuming work on Clendar and continuing to engage with this fantastic community.

Best regards,

Vinh Nguyen

### About

This project started out as a UIKit-based app for me to learn new WWDC features over the years. But one day, I decided to convert the whole app from UIKit to SwiftUI and boom, here we are.

This is the PR => [https://github.com/vinhnx/Clendar/pull/35](https://github.com/vinhnx/Clendar/pull/35)

### What's 'Clendar'?

It's just Calendar, without an 'a'. I thought it was unique, but it turns out it's not going well with ASO (App Store Optimization) and SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

Clendar is a calendar app made simpler. The application includes features like widgets, themes, keyboard shortcuts, and natural language parsing.

Its main features include:

- Widgets, with customizable dark/light themes
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Siri shortcuts
- Apple Watch complications
- Custom app icons
- Natural language parsing
- Lunar day view
- Dark and light modes built-in
- Accessibility support
- Localizations support

### SwiftUI

üìñ I believe the best way to learn is by doing. [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) is evolving and I think it's the future of writing apps.

> SwiftUI is an innovative, exceptionally simple way to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift. Build user interfaces for any Apple device using just one set of tools and APIs.
>
> -- Apple

The true power of SwiftUI, to me, is its flexibility, thanks to its vast realm of view modifiers and expressiveness with property wrappers.

You can create a "Hello, World!" app with just a few lines of code (check out the new [@main](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/app/main()) attribute!) or even, [a calendar view](https://gist.github.com/mecid/f8859ea4bdbd02cf5d440d58e936faec).

SwiftUI gives you the most flexible tool an Apple developer could ever ask for, all you need is a bit of creativity, and the [possibilities](https://github.com/Juanpe/About-SwiftUI), [are](https://github.com/chinsyo/awesome-swiftui), [limitless](https://github.com/onmyway133/awesome-swiftui).

Clendar would not be possible without the public knowledge of the community. To name a few, in no particular order:

By publishing Clendar, I would like to give back to the community. üòä

### Tip to build on M1 Macs
